# DV06-Motorsport
Details the code used for the DV06 new member project. </br> 
The google colab page for YOLOv5 was used to train the weights file. </br> 
This repository also uses the YOLOv5 detect scipts to perform all of the heavy lifting. </br> </br>
NOTE: This is still an in-progress repository in terms of deliverable and description (lots of missing things).
